 * Why this caching matters on Vercel:
 *
 * A serverless function can be "warm" (the same container handles
 * multiple requests back to back) or "cold" (a brand new container
 * spins up). If we called mongoose.connect() on every request with
 * no check, a warm container would try to open a NEW connection on
 * every single request, quickly exhausting MongoDB's connection
 * limit. This flag persists across warm invocations because the
 * module stays loaded in memory between them.
